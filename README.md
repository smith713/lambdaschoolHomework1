Homework 1
Instructions

You will need to have Google Chrome (or Mozilla Firefox but we'd recommend Chrome) dowloaded as well as an editor for your code.

If you don't already have a preferred editor then we would recommend either SublimeText3 or Atom.

For this assignment you will be using HTML and CSS to replicate the images found in the three folders inside of this project.

Each folder should have its own HTML file and CSS file. Your job is to replicate the image but in code. This is a very common task for front-end developers. Often you will receive design documents from a designer and then you will transform them into code.

You can open each HTML file in Chrome to view the work that you have done. As you make changes simply refresh the browser to see your updated code. Be sure to save your code before you refresh otherwise you will not see any changes.
